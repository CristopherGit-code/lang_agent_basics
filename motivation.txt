1. The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.
2. Believe you can and you're halfway there.
3. The harder the battle, the sweeter the victory.
4. You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.
5. If you can dream it, you can do it.
6. It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.
7. Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.
8. Everything you've ever wanted is on the other side of fear.
9. Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.
10. You learn more from failure than from success. Don't let it stop you. Failure builds character.
